## UC Davis Python Bootcamp 2021

This three-day course is designed to prepare incoming (or experienced) graduate students with little to no coding experience for the coding demands that many graduate courses and research often require. The bootcamp will take place over **September 15th-17th from 6:00pm-7:30pm** on campus in the **Chemistry Building, Room 172**. This is a great opportunity to learn a new skill and meet other graduate students! Snacks and refreshments will be provided.

Masks will be required!
